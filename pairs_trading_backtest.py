# pairs and the statistics of pairs trading. This statistical exploration provides the foundation for the strategy that his backtested in

# Pairs Trading Strategy

# <h3>
# Shorting Stocks in Pairs Trading
# </h3>
# <p>
# This section discusses the mechanics of taking a short position in a stock, which is more complicated than taking a long position.
# </p>
# <p>
# Pairs trading is a market neutral long/short strategy where the long and short positions for a pair have approximately equal
# dollar values when the position is opened. A profit is realized when there is mean reversion in the prices of a pair.
# </p>
# <p>
# When a stock is "shorted", the stock is borrowed and then immediately sold, realizing cash.  For example, if 100 shares at a current market
# price of 10 is shorted, the brokerage account will be credited with 1000 (100 x 10).  At some point in the future, the borrowed stock must be paid
# back buy buying the stock at the current market price.  A short position is profitable when the market price of the stock goes down.
# For example, if the market price of the stock shorted at 10 goes down to 6, there is a profit of 4 per share (4 x 100 = 400).
# </p>
# <p>
# Short positions can have unlimited loss when the stock price goes up.  For example, if the market price of the 10 stock rises to
# 14 per share, there is a 400 loss on the 100 share purchase. If the stock price doubles to 20 there will be a loss of 10 per share
# or 1000 for the 100 share short.
# </p>
# <p>
# Shorting stocks is often considered a risky investment strategy because of the potential of unlimited risk in short positions. Pairs
# trading uses market neutral positions where a long position is opened that is, initially, approximately equal to the dollar value of the short position.
# The pairs that are traded are chosen from the same industry sector and are highly correlated and cointegrated. If the market price of
# the shorted stock rises, the value of the long member of the pair should rise as well. The profit in the long position will tend
# to offset the loss in the short position. This makes the pairs trading strategy much less risky than a short only strategy.
# </p>
# <p>
# When a stock is shorted the stock is borrowed. This is treated as a margin loan. The brokerage requires that the customer maintain a
# balance with liquid assets of 150 percent of the amount borrowed. This includes the proceeds of the short sale, plus 50 percent.
# For example, if 100 shares of a 10 dollar stock are shorted, the account will be credited with 1000. The account must also
# have an addition balace of 500. The margin requirement can be met with cash or highly tradable "blue chip" stocks (e.g., S&P 500 stocks).
# </p>
# <p>
# When the pairs spread crosses a threshold, a long-short position is opened in the pair. The dollar value of the long and short positions
# will be approximately equal (they will usually not be exactly equal because we are trading whole share amounts).  This involves the following
# steps:
# </p>
# <ol>
# <li>
# <p>
# Open the short position. This will result in cash from the short sale.
# </p>
# <p>
# Stock A has a price of 10. Shorting 100 shares results in 1000 in cash.
# </p>
# </li>
# <li>
# <p>
# The proceeds from the short sale are used to pay for the long position. If the cash value of the short position was less than the long
# position, some additional cash will be needed to open the long position.
# </p>
# <p>
# Stock B has a price of 20 per share. A long position is taken in 50 shares. The 1000 realized from the short of stock A is used
# to pay for the long position.
# </p>
# </li>
# </ol>
# <p>
# Interactive Brokers charges a fee for short positions is 0.25 percent or 0.25/360 percent per day that the position is held. This fee is small enough that
# it can be ignored.
# </p>
# <p>
# The pairs trading strategy will have a portfolio of short and long positions which are opened and closed as the pair spread moves.
# At any time, the aggregate value of the short positions and the long positions, plus margin cash, must be within the margin
# requirements.
# </p>
# <p>
# The long positions are used for the margin requirement. Additional cash or highly liquid stocks are required for
# the margin requirement so that the total equals 150 percent of the margin at the point where the margin (short) position
# is opened. SEC regulation T requires that there must be at
# least 25% as the prices of the stocks change. Interactive Brokers (IB) calculates the margin requirements in real time and will liquidate
# account assets that cross the Reg T margin line.
# </p>
# <p>
# If there is a liquidity deficit relative to the margin, IB will liquidate the deficit amount times 4 (ouch!)

# Stock Price Data Issues
# </h3>
# <p>
# The backtest in this notebook uses the daily close price for the stocks. If a large number of stocks are traded (i.e., 100 stocks)
# the trading application would use the intraday price (perhaps with a 15 minute delay). The intraday prices will generally not be the same as
# the close price. The purpose of the backtest is not provide an indication of the profitability and risk of the pairs trading strategy, so
# this difference is acceptable.
# </p>
# <h3>
# In-sample and out-of-sample time periods
# </h3>
# <p>
# The pairs trading set is constructed by looking back over the past in-sample period. The out-of-sample period is the trading period.
# </p>
# <ul>
# <li>
# <p>
# In-sample period: six months (126 trading days)
# </p>
# </li>
# <li>
# <p>
# Out-of-sample (trading) period: three months (63 trading days). A 63 day period should be long enough to capture mean reversion.
# By using a relatively short out-of-sample period risk of holding pairs is reduced and the statistics for pairs selection can
# be calculated after the out-of-sample period.
# </p>
# </li>
# </ul>
# <h4>
# Strategy
# </h4>
# <p>
# Get pairs for each S&P 500 industrial sectors
# </p>
# <p>
# For each 126 day in-sample window (moving forward every 63 days):
# </p>
# <ol>
# <li>
# Select the pairs with close price series correlation greater than or equal to 0.75
# </li>
# <li>
# Select the high correlation pairs that show Granger cointegration
# </li>
# <li>
# Remove pairs that have the same stock (all stocks should be unique and be present in only one pair)
# </li>
# <li>
# Sort the pair spread time series by volatility (high to low volatility). Higher volatility (standard deviation) pairs
# are more likely to be profitable.
# </li>
# <li>
# Select N pairs from the unique pair list
# </li>
# </ol>
# <h4>
# Out-of-sample trading period
# </h4>
# <p>
# The pairs trading backtest is intended to be as close to actual trading as possible in order to understand whether this strategy is worth
# pursuing for actual trading.
# </p>
# <p>
# At the start date of the backtest, there is an investment of N dollars (e.g., 100,000). Of these funds, approximately 60,000 is used for
# long and short positions (e.g., 60,000 in short positions and 60,000 in long positions). The remaining approximately 40,000 is used to
# satisify the margin requirement.
# </p>
# <p>
# Positions are opened for whole share values.
# </p>
# <p>
# At the end of each trading period, any open positions will closed. The resulting cash is used in the next trading period.
# </p>
# <p>
# For each pair (in the N pair set) in the out-of-sample trading period:
# </p>
# <ol>
# <li>
# Calculate the current spread value from the current pair close prices.
# $ spread_t = Price{_A}{_t} - \beta Price{_B}{_t} $
# </li>
# <li>
# If
# $ spread_t >= \mu + \sigma \times 0.75 $
# then open a short position in
# $ A $
# and a long position in
# $ \beta B $
# </li>
# <li>
# If
# $ spread_t <= \mu + \sigma \times 0.75 $
# then open a long position in
# $ A $
# and a short position in
# $ \beta B $
# </li>
# <li>
# If there is an open pair position that has a spread that crosses the mean, the positions will be closed. The profit and
# loss amount will be updated.
# </li>
