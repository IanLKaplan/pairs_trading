    "<p>\n",
    "Statistical arbitrage and pairs trading tries to solve this problem using price relativity. If two assets share the same\n",
    "characteristics and risk exposures, then we can assume that their behavior would be similar as well. This has\n",
    "the benefit of not having to estimate the intrinsic value of an asset but rather just if it is under or overvalued\n",
    "relative to a peer(s). We only have to focus on the relationship between the two, and if the spread happens\n",
    "to widen, it could be that one of the securities is overpriced, the other is underpriced, or the mispricing is a\n",

    "Pairs trading algorithms have been reported to yield portfolios with Sharpe ratios in excess of 1.0 and returns of 10% or\n",

    "Markets tend toward efficiency and many quantitative approaches fade over time as they are adopted by hedge funds. Pairs trading\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "Pairs trading algorithms attempt to identify pairs of stocks that have mean reverting behavior. Mean reversion takes place\n",
    "around a common mean between the two stocks. The strategy is based on the idea that when one of the pairs is above or below\n",
    "the mean, it will tend to revert back to the mean.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The stock that is above the mean is shorted, on the speculation that it's price will decrease as it reverts toward the mean.\n",
    "The stock below the mean is bought, on the speculation that it's will increase as it reverts toward the mean.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Pairs trading is a \"market neutral\" strategy since both long a short positions are taken in related stocks.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Pairs trading involves two logical steps:\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "In their paper, the authors Quynh Bui and Robert Ślepaczuk write that they found correlation (on the stock prices) to be a\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The problem with using correlation alone is that stocks with high correlation may do not necessarly have mean reversion\n",
    "behavior. A better approach is to use correlation as the first filter and then apply cointegration to determine whether\n",
    "the stocks are mean reverting.\n",

    "Cointegration\n",
