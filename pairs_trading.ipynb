    "Pairs trading is an approach that takes advantage of the\n",
    "mispricing between two (or more) co-moving assets, by\n",
    "taking a long position in one(many) and shorting the\n",

    "Pairs trading is a so called statistical arbitrage trading strategy.\n",

    "<blockquote>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Statistical arbitrage and pairs trading tries to solve this problem using price relativity. If two assets share the same\n",
    "characteristics and risk exposures, then we can assume that their behavior would be similar as well. This has\n",
    "the benefit of not having to estimate the intrinsic value of an asset but rather just if it is under or overvalued\n",
    "relative to a peer(s). We only have to focus on the relationship between the two, and if the spread happens\n",
    "to widen, it could be that one of the securities is overpriced, the other is underpriced, or the mispricing is a\n",
    "combination of both.\n",

    "Overview\n",
    "</h3>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Pairs trading algorithms attempt to identify pairs of stocks that have mean reverting behavior. Mean reversion takes place\n",
    "around a common mean between the two stocks. The strategy is based on the idea that when one of the pairs is above or below\n",
    "the mean, it will tend to revert back to the mean.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The stock that is above the mean is shorted, on the speculation that it's price will decrease in price as it reverts to the mean.\n",
    "The stock that is below the mean is bought, on the speculation that it's will increase as it reverst to the mean.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Pairs trading is a \"market neutral\" strategy since both long a short positions are taken in related stocks.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Pairs trading involves two logical steps:\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Identify a pair of stocks that are likely to have mean reverting behavior using a lookback period.\n",

    "<li>\n",

    "Trading the stocks using the long/short strategy over the trading period.\n",

    "Pairs Identification\n",
    "</h3>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "In their paper, the authors Quynh Bui and Robert Ślepaczuk write that they found correlation to be a stronger identification of\n",
    "pairs than cointegration or the Hurst exponent.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The problem with using correlation alone is that it will not necessarly identify stocks that mean revert. A stronger approach\n",
    "is to use correlation as a first filter and then apply cointegration to determine whether the stocks are mean reverting.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<h3>\n",
    "Cointegration\n",
    "</h3>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Cointegration is used to recognize asset pairs that are canidates for pairs trading. See the reference section for discussions on cointegration.\n",
